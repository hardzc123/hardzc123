### HiðŸ‘‹
My name is Chi Zhang, 

I just graduated from RWTH Aachen University with an automation engineering master degree. 

I am eager to work as a robotics engineer.

I hope the Github repositories can give you some short impression about my project experience.

My vision: robot will do much more than it can do now in 20 years, I would like ro take part in this transformation actively.
