### Hi,
My name is Chi Zhang and I have finished my master in automation engineering with focus on robotics this year. I would like to work in your company as a robotics software engineer.


 I have 3 years experience in developing robotics applications. For example, developing control algorithms for rehabilitation robots and implementing virtual reality gamification, applying computer vision for object pose detection and robot motion path planning.
 
 I have the following skills: Strong technical and implementation skills, knowledge of C++, Java and Python, good coding style, knowledge of software development tools such as Git, Docker and knowledge of agile(Scrum) development methods. Proficiency in ROS, Linux and other related systems. Proficiency in PID, MPC, hybrid force control and other control algorithms, robot dynamics, MATLAB/Simulink programming and modeling. I am familiar with computer vision libraries such as OpenCV and PCL, and the deep learning framework PyTorch and Tensorflow. I am fluent in English, German, and Chinese. I have a structured working style. I also have strong teamwork and communication skills.
 
 Hope to work with you in the future.
